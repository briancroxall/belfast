                     <l n="1" id="d0e893">Going home alone this deserted Saturday,</l>
                     <l id="d0e895">As a child goes back to heaven, the longest way,</l>
                     <l id="d0e897">I knock at my usual doors to company</l>
                     <l id="d0e899">But pubs and coffee-lounge are closed, even the library.</l>
                     <l id="d0e901">It is clear to my mind when lifted awhile from self-pity</l>
                     <l id="d0e903">That blessings fall as surely as the soot</l>
                     <l id="d0e905">That made this spire a member of the black city -</l>
                     <l id="d0e907">God's mission to bankers or banker's loot.</l>
                     <l id="d0e909">Red-brick terrace houses and bare trees</l>
                     <l id="d0e911">Etched on a water-coloured sky, a cage of girders,</l>
                     <l id="d0e913">The worn pavement, all that my eye sees</l>
                     <l id="d0e915">Please me, being themselves, my beloved warders.</l>
                     <l id="d0e917">They are clothed in today's unique weather - not queer</l>
                     <l id="d0e919">But clearly defined by hour, season and year.</l>
                     <l id="d0e921">I am blessed and neglect the blessing and walk again,</l>
                     <l id="d0e923">Blindly hearing the mind rehearse its pain.</l>
                     <l id="d0e925">"I am not myself.  These streets were the scene</l>
                     <l id="d0e927">Of my daily life.  Involved in projects and routine</l>
                     <l id="d0e929">I passed here often and return as a ghost</l>
                     <l id="d0e931">To tour sites, seeing where my time was lost.</l>
                     <l id="d0e933">Ghosts should accuse their murderers;  I shiver</l>
                     <l id="d0e935">At my own moaning but have no message to deliver.</l>
                     <l id="d0e937">A perturbed spirit with meal time for a clock</l>
                     <l id="d0e939">I start back as the bells say, "six o'clock"</l>
                     <l id="d0e941">To the nicest woman I have ever met,</l>
                     <l id="d0e943">Where my bed is made and tea table set.</l>
