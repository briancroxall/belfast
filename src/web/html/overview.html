        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 1963 Philip Hobsbaum, 
          a recently-arrived lecturer in English at Queen's University, Belfast, 
          organized a writing workshop made up of students, faculty, and a number 
          of writers from the local community. The group was patterned after a 
          similar workshop that Hobsbaum had organized first in Cambridge, then 
          in London, between 1955 and 1962. The Group, as it has come to be known, 
          met regularly during term at No. 4 Fitzwilliam Street, Philip and Hannah 
          Hobsbaum's home near the university. Three years later, when Hobsbaum 
          left Belfast for the University of Glasgow, Seamus Heaney assumed responsibility 
          for organizing the meetings, which moved to his and Marie Heaney's home 
          on Ashley Avenue. Later Michael Allen and Arthur Terry, both lecturers 
          at Queen's, played organizational roles as well. The Belfast Group lasted, 
          with occasional interruptions, for nine years. It finally ceased altogether 
          in 1972 at a time of political upheaval in Northern Ireland and at a 
          time when a remarkable number of the participants had published their 
          first collections and launched promising literary careers. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the early years, the Group 
          was directly shaped by Hobsbaum. Writers were invited&#151;and, on occasion, 
          uninvited&#151;by him, and the sessions followed a format that he put 
          in place. Typically the featured writer would give him a selection of 
          new work, and Hobsbaum would then make a further selection for presentation 
          at the Group meeting. He would then pass the poems, short stories, or 
          other work on to either Cilla Craig, the Secretary in the English Department, 
          or to his wife, Hannah, who would type and make copies on the department's 
          Roneo duplicator. These Group sheets, as they have come to be known, 
          would be distributed to the members, and the following Tuesday (later 
          Monday) the Group would meet at 8:00 in the evening to hear the featured 
          writer read his or her work. While the emphasis was on new poetry, short 
          stories and other prose work was also welcome. Arthur Terry, Professor 
          of Spanish at Queen's, presented verse translations from the Catal&#x00E1;n, 
          and Stewart Parker read from his experimental prose.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hobsbaum reports that the 
          first half of the Group meetings was always devoted to the work of a 
          single writer, and that those present would discuss each piece immediately 
          after it was read. Hobsbaum set an example for text-based, close reading 
          that some found intimidating. Jack Pakenham, a school teacher at the 
          time, has written "woe to any unsuspecting poet who could not stand 
          over every single word written."<sup><a href="#1">1</a><a name="text1"></a></sup> 
          Michael Longley recalls that while he expected sharp criticism, he was 
          "surprised by the ferocity of Hobsbaum's attack."<sup><a href="#1">2</a><a name="text2"></a></sup> 
          At the close of the reading and discussion, there would be a brief break 
          for coffee and biscuits, before reconvening for an open session where 
          anyone could read work they wished to share. Philip Hobsbaum recalls 
          Arthur Terry reading Robert Lowell in the second half of a Group meeting, 
          and Michael Allen remembers Marie Devlin (later Heaney) reading her 
          own poems.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> After Hobsbaum's departure 
          for Glasgow in 1966, the Group continued to meet under the direction 
          of Seamus Heaney. Later Arthur Terry and Michael Allen shared this organizational 
          role with Heaney, and the Group moved variously between the Heaney's 
          home on Ashley Avenue to a nearby pub on the Lisburn Road, the Four 
          in Hand. The format of the meetings remained unchanged, though at some 
          point coffee was replaced by pints. Among the new writers who joined 
          the Group meetings in these later years were Paul Muldoon and Ciaran 
          Carson. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There has been much disagreement 
          about the importance of these Group meetings and the role they played 
          in the emergence of a new generation of poets from Northern Ireland. 
          Derek Mahon has insisted he was not a Group member at all and that he 
          only attended one meeting when he happened to be in Belfast visiting 
          Michael and Edna Longley. For his part, Michael Longley has written 
          that he never altered even one semi-colon as a result of Group discussion 
          (though Longley Group sheets show that he revised a number of poems&#151;among 
          them "Christopher at Birth," "Elegy for Fats Waller," and "Gathering 
          Mushrooms"&#151;and presented them more than once). What is not in dispute, 
          however, is that a remarkable number of the participants went on to 
          become highly accomplished writers. Many of the poems collected in Seamus 
          Heaney's first published collection, <i>Death of a Naturalist,</i> were 
          first read aloud in Group meetings, among them "Digging," "Personal 
          Helicon," and "Blackberry-Picking." Similarly the Belfast Group provided 
          a forum for early work by James Simmons, Michael Longley, Paul Muldoon, 
          and Ciaran Carson. For each of these writers, the Group provided an 
          early audience, for some their very first. As Seamus Heaney has put 
          it, "What happened Monday night after Monday night in the Hobsbaum's 
          flat in Fitzwilliam Street somehow ratified the activity of writing 
          for all of us who shared it."<sup><a href="#1">3</a><a name="text3"></a></sup> 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Group published no magazine 
          and produced no anthology of the kind the London Group did, but it was 
          always closely allied with</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> the Belfast-based literary 
          magazines of the time. Seamus Heaney and Michael Longley edited the 
          <i>Northern Review</i> from 1965-1969 and, as a result, they were well-positioned 
          to solicit new work of other Group members. The contributors notes to 
          the early issues of the magazine read like a roll call of Group members; 
          present are John Bond, Philip Hobsbaum, Stewart Parker, Paul Smyth, 
          Arthur Terry, and Joan Watton (later Newmann), in addition to Heaney 
          and Longley themselves. Similarly the inaugural issue of Harry Chambers' 
          <i>Phoenix</i> magazine contains poems by three Group members: Heaney, 
          Longley, and Iris Bull. Even after Chambers took the magazine with him 
          to Manchester, he continued to publish a generous sampling of new work 
          by Group poets. In 1968 James Simmons founded the <i>Honest Ulsterman,</i> 
          the longest running literary magazine to come out of the North, and 
          he too turned often to Group members to fill the new magazine. While 
          there was no formal linkage between the Group and these publishing ventures, 
          the Group certainly contributed to the new sense that there was enough 
          literary activity in the North to justify such efforts. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The participation of so many 
          talented writers ensures that the Group will remain of lasting interest 
          to scholars and literary historians. These pages collect a substantial 
          amount of documentary information on the history of the Belfast Group, 
          including biographical notes on the participants (well-known and obscure), 
          a catalog of all known Group sheets, and fully searchable electronic 
          texts of Group sheets by Seamus Heaney, Philip Hobsbaum, Michael Longley, 
          Paul Muldoon, and James Simmons. The Electronic Poetry Project continues 
          to seek permission to include the work of other participants on these 
          pages. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original Group sheets, 
          from which these electronic texts have been prepared, are housed in 
          the Special Collections Department of the Robert W. Woodruff Library 
          of Emory University and in the Irish Collection of the Queen's University 
          Library. (Two additional Group sheets are in private hands.) While the 
          large majority of sheets are not dated, some do include handwritten 
          notations with date, place, and time information. When present, this 
          information has been provided here. Typically Group sheets were produced 
          on a cyclostyle duplicator on uniform paper measuring 8 x 13 inches 
          (20 cm x 33 cm). <font size="1">(Click on group sheet to view larger
