        <a name="note1"/>Philip Hobsbaum, "The Belfast Group: A Recollection," 
        Eire-Ireland, Vol 32, Nos. 2 &amp; 3: p. 173). <br/>
        [<a href="#note1r"><b>return to text</b></a>] <br/>
        <br/>
        <sup>2</sup> <a name="note2"/>The original Group sheet in the Hobsbaum 
        Collection at Queen's dates "The Dress" April 12, 1966 (likely the date 
        the poem was completed). If Philip Hobsbaum left Belfast for Glasgow in 
        March 1966, as he recalls in his essay "The Belfast Group: A Recollection" 
        (Eire-Ireland, Vol 32, Nos. 2 &amp; 3: p. 173), then it is unclear how this 
        Group sheet made its way into the Hobsbaum Collection. <br/>
        [<a href="#note2r"><b>return to text</b></a>] <br/>
        <br/>
        <sup>3</sup> <a name="note3"/>The Group sheet in the Michael Longley 
        Papers includes the handwritten note April 27, 1965 (Longley Papers, Robert 
        W. Woodruff Library, Emory University). <br/>
        [<a href="#note3r"><b>return to text</b></a>] <br/>
        <br/>
        <sup>4</sup> <a name="note4"/>Philip Hobsbaum, "The Belfast Group: 
        A Recollection," ibid., p. 175. <br/>
        [<a href="#note4r"><b>return to text</b></a>] <br/>
        <br/>
        <sup>5</sup> <a name="note5"/>The Group sheet in the Longley Papers 
        includes corrections and notes in the margin in an unidentified hand. 
        <br/>
        [<a href="#note5r"><b>return to text</b></a>] <br/>
        <br/>
        <sup>6</sup> <a name="note6"/>The original Group sheet is dated 22 
        Nov. 1964; however, this is likely the date the final poem, "The Hebrides," 
        was completed rather than the date the sheet was prepared or presented. 
        The copy of this worksheet in the Michael Longley Papers includes substantial 
        deletions to the text. <br/>
        [<a href="#note6r"><b>return to text</b></a>] <br/>
        <br/>
        <sup>7</sup> <a name="note7"/>Bernard McLaverty's short story "Jim 
        Scroggy" is not in the Hobsbaum Collection at Queen's; however, Hobsbaum 
        recalls that this "early story" was presented during his chairmanship 
        of the Group ("The Belfast Group: A Recollection," ibid., p. 178). <br/>
        [<a href="#note7r"><b>return to text</b></a>] <br/>
        <br/>
        <sup>8</sup> <a name="note8"/>After Philip Hobsbaum's departure for 
        Glasgow, the Group meetings were organized at various times by Seamus 
        Heaney, Arthur Terry, and Michael Allen. There was a suspension of the 
        Group meetings in the 1967-1968 year (Michael Allen to ____, 4 Oct. 1968, 
        Irish Literary Miscellany, Robert W. Woodruff Library, Emory University) 
        , followed by a full year interruption in 1970-1971 while Heaney was at 
        the University of California at Berkeley. The Group finally ceased meeting 
        altogether during the 1971-1972 school year. <br/>
        [<a href="#note8r"><b>return to text</b></a>] <br/>
        <br/>
        <sup>9</sup> <a name="note9"/>Date reported by Michael Allen in letter 
        to the author. <br/>
        [<a href="#note9r"><b>return to text</b></a>] <br/>
        <br/>
        <sup>10</sup> <a name="note10"/>The copies of the Group sheets in the 
        James Simmons Papers and in the Ciaran Carson Papers both include a handwritten 
        note Monday, November 8th. (Simmons Papers &amp; Carson Papers, Robert W. 
        Woodruff Library, Emory University). <br/>
        [<a href="#note10r"><b>return to text</b></a>] <br/>
        <br/>
        <sup>11</sup> <a name="note11"/>Of his own Group Sheets, Philip Hobsbaum 
        recalls, "'Dead End' was the latest and was one that was read out and 
        discussed when I was a resident in Glasgow after Belfast, on one of the 
        occasions that I went back as a visitor" (Philip Hobsbaum, letter to the 
        author, 14 Dec. 1998). <br/>
